- Modified object which is the value of property "properties" for each "properties" property like this:
	removed "shapeGroup", "shapeId", "shapeISO" and "shapeType" properties,
	renamed property "shapeName" to "name" and added properties "population2013" and "population1991".
	Values of these new properties are objects containing properties: "overall", "croats", "serbs" and "bosniaks",
	values of which are numbers of overall population and population of each major nation inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in years 2013. and 1991. across municipality/city.
	Data about overall population and population of each major nation in years 1991. and 2013. for each municipality/city

	Value of "total" property is object also containing properties "population2013" and "population1991".

	values of which represent numbers of overall population and population of each major nation inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in years 2013. and 1991. across the whole country.
	These values were calculated by summing values of appropriate "overall", "croats", "serbs" or "bosniaks" property
	from appropriate "population2013" or "population1991" property from "properties" property for each "properties" property.
